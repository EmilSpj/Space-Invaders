- PyGame

## How To Use


#### Installation

Download the code, Python and Pygame. Then run it with this command. 
```powershell
python3 main.py
```

#### Customization

You can enable or disable sound from the enemy lasers, it is disabled as a default. It is removed becuas its a noisy and the audio gets buggy.

To enable remove the # from this lines

```py
151 #           BULLET_FIRE_SOUND.play()
```
